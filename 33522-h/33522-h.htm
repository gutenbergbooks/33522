<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE'S COUSIN NELLY.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> another little book I have
given you an account of Frankie
when he was a baby, and have
spoken of some things which he
said and did when he began to
talk and to walk.</p>

<p>In this book I shall tell you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
more about him, and also about
his cousin Nelly, who came to
pass some months in his father's
house, while her parents visited
Europe.</p>

<p>Nelly was six years old, while
Frankie was but just past his
fourth birthday. Nelly was a
pale, delicate child, with light
flaxen hair, which curled in
ringlets about her face. Her
features were very small; but
her eyes were bright and sparkling,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and her motions quick and
graceful.</p>

<p>Sally, the nurse, used often to
say that Nelly looked like the
great wax dolls which were put
up in the shop windows; but her
cousin Willie laughed, and said,
"Nelly flies about so, I can't tell
what she does look like."</p>

<p>When Nelly was a baby, she
had learned to suck her finger;
and since that time she had
never been taught to give up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the habit. Before her mother
went to Europe, Mrs. Gray
showed her that the poor little
finger was wasting away, and
would never grow like the others,
unless Nelly would stop sucking
it. But the lady only laughed,
and said, "I have not the heart
to forbid her, she takes such a
world of comfort with it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray said no more, but
she determined to break up the
habit before Nelly left her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The little girl was to have
a small room, opening out of
her aunt's chamber. There her
trunks were carried for Sally to
unpack, and put the clothes into
the wardrobe and drawers.</p>

<p>"Come in here!" said Nelly
to her little cousin, "and we will
take out the playthings. This
trunk is full of them."</p>

<p>Frankie's eyes grew very
round and large as Sally selected
the right key, and displayed a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
great variety of toys packed as
closely as possible into the large
trunk.</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" exclaimed
nurse, holding up both hands.
"Why, you'll be able to set up
a toy shop, miss."</p>

<p>"I have more at home," said
Nelly. "Maria couldn't get them
all in."</p>

<p>Maria was the name of the
colored woman who had taken
care of Nelly ever since she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a tiny baby. She had wished to
come with her to Mrs. Gray's,
and cried bitterly when she knew
that she could not. But her aunt
was sure that if Maria was there,
Nelly would be too much indulged,
that is, she would have her
own way, and would be spoiled.
She loved her little niece, and
was sorry that her brother's wife
did not take more pains to teach
her little girl to be good and
kind. She hoped Nelly would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
learn, while her mother was
away, to wait upon herself, and
to be generous and truthful.</p>

<p>When Sally had unlocked the
trunk of playthings for the little
miss, she went on unpacking the
other one. She took out the
dresses, and laid them on the
bed. There was a pink muslin,
and a blue tarleton, and a white
one with the skirt tucked up to
the waist. Then there were
two silks, and one or two delaines,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and ever so many French
calicoes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray came in at this
moment, and Sally exclaimed,
"Where I am to put all these
dresses, ma'am, is more than I
can tell. The wardrobe won't
hold half of them."</p>

<p>The lady glanced toward the
bed, and said, "You may hang
the best ones in the parlor-chamber
closet."</p>

<p>By this time Frankie had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
helped his cousin to take out
the toys; and they were spread
all over the floor, so that neither
his mamma nor nurse could
walk at all without stepping on
them.</p>

<p>"Why, Nelly," said her aunt,
"what a quantity of playthings
you have there!"</p>

<p>"May we play with them
here?" asked Frankie.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will be in
Sally's way," replied mamma.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"She can wait, then, till we are
done," said Nelly, taking up a
large dolly.</p>

<p>"No," said her aunt; "nurse
has a great deal to do; and first
of all she wants to clear up this
room. See how untidy it looks,
with the clothes all lying about."</p>

<p>"Can't we go up in Willie's
play room, then?" asked the
little boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear; there is a
large case up there, which will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
make a nice play house for Nelly.
You can have one shelf for the
parlor, and put these little sofas
and chairs in it. Then have
another for the closet, and set
out the cups and saucers. You
and your cousin may carry them
up stairs; and when Margie
comes home, she will love to
help you arrange them."</p>

<p>"O mamma, see this pretty
carriage!" cried Frankie.</p>

<p>"That's a pedler's wagon,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
said Nelly. "There is the front
seat for him to sit on, and the
top comes way over to keep off
the rain. The horses can take
out too. When I first had it,
I used to play 'get to the tavern,
and put them up in the barn.'"</p>

<p>"O Nelly!" exclaimed the
little fellow, "let us play that as
soon as we get up stairs."</p>

<p>"I'm tired," said Nelly, sitting
down on the floor, and putting
her finger in her mouth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll carry the things up then,"
said Frankie, running into the
next room for a basket. "See,
I'm real strong."</p>

<p>"If you are tired, you had
better go and lie down on the
lounge," said her aunt.</p>

<p>"No," said Nelly; "I want to
stay here, and see Sally put away
my clothes."</p>

<p>Nurse did not take a fancy to
the little girl; that was very plain.
She kept muttering to herself all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the time she was arranging the
drawers, and was quite vexed
that her darling, as she called
Frankie, should be doing the
work while Nelly sat idly looking
on.</p>

<p>At last, when her mistress had
left the room, she asked, "Do
you never work any, miss?"</p>

<p>Nelly shook her head.</p>

<p>"Well, I expect your aunt
will teach you to wait upon
yourself," said Sally; "you'd be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a great deal happier if you had
something to do."</p>

<p>"Maria does every thing for
me," said Nelly, still holding her
finger in her mouth. "If I don't
like to stay without her, I shall
send for her to come. Mamma
said I might."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said nurse, laughing.
"We'll see what your aunt
says to that. Here, darling,"
she called out to Frankie, "let
Sally help you carry that heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
basket. I'm afraid you can't get
it through the door alone."</p>

<p>"Yet I can," said Frankie,
"cause I belong to the Try
Company."</p>

<p>"I guess your cousin had better
join it too," said nurse to
herself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MOSES AND THE ORANGE.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mamma</span>," said Frankie one
day, "you promised to tell me
a toly."</p>

<p>"So I did," said mamma; "and
what shall it be about?"</p>

<p>"Bout Moses."</p>

<p>"Moses in the bulrushes?"
asked mamma.</p>

<p>"No; bout Moses and the
olange."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The lady thought a minute
before she could remember what
he meant. Then she smiled, and
said, "O, yes, I'll tell that. Do
you like to hear stories, Nelly?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Nelly.
"Maria sometimes tells me
pretty ones."</p>

<p>"Well, you may bring the
cricket, and sit down by Frankie.
I think you will like to hear
about Moses," said aunty. "He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was just as old as you are, Nelly;
and like you, he was an only
child. His father and mother
were very fond of him, and loved
to do every thing to make him
happy. I don't mean that they
always let him have his own
way, or allowed him to do what
was wrong, for that would have
made him grow very selfish and
wicked.</p>

<p>"The day before he was six
years old, his mother thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
she would let him have a party.
So she asked his father to bring
from the city some oranges, and
figs, and nuts, that the little folks
might have a feast.</p>

<p>"When papa had gone to town,
which he did every day, because
his store was there, she went to
the kitchen, and helped the cook
make some light sponge cake for
Moses to have for his party.</p>

<p>"The little fellow knelt in a
chair close by the table, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
watched her sift the sugar and
beat the eggs; then, when she
put in the lemon, and took a
clean spoon to taste a little to
know whether it was seasoned
right, Moses said, 'I should like
to taste too.'</p>

<p>"By and by the cake was done,
and smelled so good that Moses
asked for a piece; but his mother
told him to wait until his
cousins were there to eat it
with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then the carriage came up to
the door, and James, the hostler,
rung the bell to let his mistress
know he was ready to drive her
out. She dressed her little boy
in his new suit, and told him he
might go with her.</p>

<p>"They drove first to aunt Mary's,
and mamma invited George
and Walter, and little Katy.
Then they went a mile farther,
to uncle John's, where Susy,
William, and Grace gladly promised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to come. On their way
home, they called upon three of
their neighbors, where the number
was increased to eleven.</p>

<p>"When his father came home
from the city, he brought a basket
in one hand, and two large
bundles under his other arm.</p>

<p>"Moses ran to meet him, and
said, 'Let me carry the basket,
papa. It isn't too heavy for me.'</p>

<p>"Before he put it on the table,
he peeped in, and said, 'O, what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
nice oranges, papa!' The little
boy was very fond of oranges.</p>

<p>"That night Moses went to
bed very happy. He longed for
the time when his young companions
would come, and lay
awake nearly an hour, thinking
what a very pleasant party his
would be.</p>

<p>"The next morning he was
up long before his mother, and
ran down stairs to see if breakfast
was ready. The table was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
not yet laid; and he went into
the large store closet to see
where his mother had put the
oranges and cake. There was
the basket upon the first shelf,
and on lifting the lid he saw
that the oranges were still in
it. How fresh and good they
smelt! He put in his hand
and took one out. 'O, what a
large one!'</p>

<p>"The basket was so full, he
thought there must be more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
than twelve; so he stood up on
a box, and began to count them.
'Yes, there are,' he said to himself;
'there are twelve, and one
more.'</p>

<p>"Then he took the largest, and
laid it on the next shelf, while
he put the others back again into
the basket, wishing all the time
that he could have it for his own.
He knew that he should have
one at the party, but he couldn't
wait. 'I want one now,' he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"He sat down on the box, and
began to smell the large orange
which he had left out. Then he
made a small hole in the peel,
and began to suck the juice
through it. It tasted so sweet,
he could not get his mouth away.
So he squeezed and sucked, and
sucked and squeezed, until the
juice was all gone, and nothing remained
but the skin and the pulp.</p>

<p>"'O, dear! I'm sorry I've eaten
it,' he whispered; 'I didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
mean to. I only thought I would
suck it a little. How quick it
all came out!'</p>

<p>"Just then he heard cook
come into the room to set the
table for breakfast, and he knew
his mother would soon be down.
He began to be very unhappy,
and to wish he were back again
in his little bed. Then he remembered
it was his birthday;
but some how the thought of his
party gave him no pleasure."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess Satan was whispering
to him," said Frankie. "If
I had been there, I would open
the door, and say, 'Satan, go
wight out.'"</p>

<p>"Who is Satan?" asked Nelly,
who had been listening with
great interest.</p>

<p>"Satan's naughty man," said
Frankie. "He don't love good
boys."</p>

<p>"He is the evil spirit," replied
aunty, "who tries to make boys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and girls, and men and women
too, behave naughty and sin
against God."</p>

<p>"Does he live in Moses' house?"
asked the little girl.</p>

<p>"He is every where, my dear,"
said the lady, "trying to make
people do mischief. He was
there in the closet with Moses,
and when the little boy's naughty
heart said, 'I would steal one of
my mother's oranges and eat it,'
he said, 'Yes; no one will know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
it, and if your mother asks you
about it, you can tell her a lie,
and say you didn't touch it.'"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't take your olange,
mamma," said Frankie, putting
his arms round his mother's neck
and kissing her. "I would ask
you, 'May I?'"</p>

<p>At this moment a lady called
to see mamma, and she said,
"You may go and play now, and
I will finish the story about
Moses some other time."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE'S SICKNESS.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night Frankie was quite
sick, and his mother, after being
up with him several times, lay
down by him in his trundle-bed.
He was very much pleased at
this, and put up his little hot
hand on her face. The fever
made him quite wakeful, and he
wanted to talk. She began to
repeat the little rhyme,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Once there was a little man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where a little river ran,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>when he said, "Mamma, please
tell me 'bout heaven."</div>

<p>"Do you want to go to heaven?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, when I die;
but I can't go 'lone. I want
you to go with me. Won't you
please to ask God to let us take
hold of hands and go wight up
to heaven together. That would
be a pretty way; wouldn't it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Gray bent over her darling
boy and kissed his cheek.
She whispered a prayer to God
to preserve her dear child from
death for a long time to come.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he spoke again:
"How can you get up to heaven,
mamma?"</p>

<p>"God will send his angels, my
dear, and take me there."</p>

<p>"I 'fraid they can't lift you,
mamma, you so heavy. But you
can go up on the barn, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
they can get you up there; can't
they?" In a minute, he asked,
"Does God have horses in heaven,
mamma?"</p>

<p>Toward morning, he sank into
a quiet sleep, and did not awake
until Willie and Margie had gone
to school. When he opened his
eyes, his mamma was standing
over him with a cup of milk and
water in her hand.</p>

<p>"Frankie feel better," he said,
starting up to receive her kiss.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>As he still felt weak, his mamma
held him in her lap, where he
could look at Ponto, who was
washing his paws on the rug.
Presently Nelly came in, carrying
a wax doll nearly as large as
herself. She was a little afraid
of Ponto, and when he went and
put his nose on her arm, and
tried to lick her hand, she cried,
"Get away, you ugly dog! I
hate you, I do!" and she struck
him with the doll.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Ponto growled, and turned
away to Frankie. The little
fellow slipped down from his
mother's lap, and clasped his
arms around Ponto's neck. "O,
you good dog," he said, "I love
you, I do."</p>

<p>Ponto knew very well what
this meant, and he rapped with
his tail as hard as he could on
the rug. Then Frankie made
the dog lie down, and he laid his
head upon him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Ponto was delighted to have
his little master use him for a
pillow; so he lay very still indeed.
I suppose he thought
Frankie wished to go to sleep.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Gray told Nelly
how the good dog had pulled
Frankie out of the water, and
how much they all loved him.
But Nelly only said, "I hate
dogs, I do, they're so ugly and
cross;" and then she put her
finger in her mouth again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma," said Frankie, "I
want to hear 'bout Moses 'gen.
Pease, mamma, tell me toly 'bout
Moses."</p>

<p>"Well," said mamma, "I'll get
my sewing and tell you the rest
of the story." So Frankie lay
with his head on Ponto, and
listened to mamma. Nelly sat
in her little chair, and sucked
her finger and tended her doll.
"I told you," said the lady, "that
Moses began to wish he had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
touched the orange; but it was
of no use to wish that now, for
there it was all squeezed and
sucked, and what should he do
with it?</p>

<p>"When the cook had set the
table, she rang the bell, and
presently his father and mother
came down to breakfast.</p>

<p>"'Where's Moses?' asked his
mamma; 'I expected to find him
at the table.'</p>

<p>"'He came down early,' said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the cook; 'but I have not seen
him for a good while.'</p>

<p>"'Won't you see if he is out
doors?' said the lady.</p>

<p>"Moses knew it was of no use
for him to wait any longer; so
he came out laughing.</p>

<p>"'Why, what were you doing,
my dear?' asked the lady.</p>

<p>"'I was hiding,' said the boy."</p>

<p>"O, that was a naughty lie!"
exclaimed Frankie.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, when children do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
one naughty thing, they almost
always do another. Moses had
stolen his mother's orange, and
now he told a lie to hide it.
His mother did not think he
would act so wickedly. She
asked, 'Do you remember, Moses,
this is your birthday.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, mamma.'</p>

<p>"'You have a very pleasant
day for your party,' said his
father; and then Moses began to
talk about what he should play<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
when his company came. 'Shall
you have the supper first?' he
asked.</p>

<p>"'No, my dear. I shall wait
until you have played a while.'</p>

<p>"After breakfast the lady
swept and dusted the parlors, to
have them ready for the party.
Then she sat down to her sewing,
while she heard Moses read
and spell. After this he went
out doors to play with his hoop.</p>

<p>"In the middle of the afternoon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
she began to arrange for
her little feast. First, she took
the nut-cracker and cracked the
large walnuts, the almonds, and
the filberts, and put them in the
glass dishes ready to set them
on the table. Then she cut the
cake into square pieces, and
grated sugar over them. After
that, she put the figs into plates,
and then brought out the basket
of oranges.</p>

<p>"All this time, Moses had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
kneeling in his chair by the table,
watching her as she worked.
He looked very sober. He was
thinking about the orange, and
wished he had not taken it.</p>

<p>"When his mother began to
take the oranges from the basket,
he felt as if he should cry, he
was so afraid she would find out
what he had done.</p>

<p>"'Why,' said the lady to herself,
'here are only twelve. I
asked him to get thirteen.' She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
counted them over again. All at
once she looked at Moses, and
said, 'I hope you have not eaten
one of mother's oranges, my
dear.'</p>

<p>"'No,' said the little boy, 'I
haven't touched one.'"</p>

<p>"O, dear!" said Frankie. "I'm
afraid God won't love Moses any
more, he is so naughty, and tells
so many lies."</p>

<p>Frankie jumped up when he
said this, and Ponto took the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
opportunity to turn himself over.
He had lain very still before,
for fear of disturbing his little
master.</p>

<p>"'What did you want thirteen
for?' asked Moses. 'You said
there would be twelve at the
party.'</p>

<p>"'Because I meant to send one
to Sarah Christie. Joseph and
Belle are coming, but Sarah is
sick, you know; so I meant to
send her one. I suppose your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
father forgot it; but I'm very
sorry.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray was going on to
tell the rest of the story, but
she saw that Frankie looked very
pale, and she stopped.</p>

<p>"I want to womit," said he,
and she ran quickly to get the
bowl. Then she gave him some
medicine, and put him into bed,
while she sent Nelly to play out
doors until he awoke.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>NELLY'S PUNISHMENT.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a few days Frankie was
quite well again, and able to
play merrily with Nelly, who
had sadly missed him in her
out-door exercise.</p>

<p>The little girl had not been
long with her aunt before the
lady saw that the right training
of her niece would require much
skill and patience. Nelly had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
never been taught to obey, and
could not be made to understand
why she should not have her
own way, as she had done at
home. There was another thing
which made her aunt feel very
badly. She found that, young
as Nelly was, she had already
learned to deceive, and no one
could trust her word a moment.
Then she was selfish, and while
she would not oblige her cousins
by lending them her books or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
toys, she was very angry if they
did not at once yield theirs to
her, when she asked for them.</p>

<p>She was so pert and uncivil
in her talk, that Sally, and even
Jane, disliked to have her about;
and at last her aunt was obliged
to shut her in her own room,
she spoke so impudently to the
servants. Instead of asking the
nurse to do her a favor, as the
other children did, she used to
say, "Go right up stairs quick,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Sally, and get my bonnet;" and
once, when Sally did not start,
she said, "You're an ugly girl,"
and struck her in the face.</p>

<p>Nurse started forward to hold
her hands, when at this moment
Mrs. Gray entered the room.</p>

<p>Nelly was ashamed that her
aunt had heard her, for she loved
her aunt better than any one in
the house; but when the lady
took her hand firmly to lead her
up stairs, she screamed and struggled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to get away. "I don't like
to stay here," she cried; "this
is an ugly house. I wish my
mamma would come home and
take me away."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray led her to a chair
in her own room, and going out
locked the door after her. But
Nelly kicked and pounded the
door so hard, and threw over
the chairs, that her aunt was
obliged to call Sally to help her
tie the naughty girl to a chair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>She was very sorry to do this,
and the tears were in her eyes;
but Sally was right glad to have
the child punished as she deserved.
Indeed, she had told
Jane the day before that she did
not see how mistress had so
much patience with the naughty
child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray did not intend to
hurt Nelly. She only meant to
fasten her hands and feet to the
chair so as to prevent her doing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
any more mischief. She took
large towels from the washstand
to do this; but Nelly kicked and
screamed, and at last made a
great scratch on her aunt's face.
After that Sally took the child
in her arms, and held her so
tight she could not move.</p>

<p>When they had fastened her
firmly to her seat, they went
out, and left her to think of her
bad conduct.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray went into her closet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and asked God to direct her what
to do in order to make Nelly a
good, obedient child.</p>

<p>After an hour she went back,
and said, "Are you sorry, my
dear, that you have been so
naughty?"</p>

<p>"I don't love you. I want to
go to Maria," was the only reply.</p>

<p>Her aunt sighed, when she
found the little girl was not at
all subdued, and she went out
again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>If Nelly could have put her
finger in her mouth, it would
have been no punishment for
her to stay there, for she could
lie back in the chair and go to
sleep.</p>

<p>When her uncle came home
to dinner, he found Willie, and
Frankie, and mamma, sitting silent
and sad in the parlor, while
from above stairs came the sound
of loud and angry crying. The
lady wept as she told her husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
how naughty Nelly had behaved.
"I had no idea," she said,
"that she had so bad a temper."</p>

<p>"Shall I go up and talk with
her?" asked the gentleman.</p>

<p>"If you think it best," replied
mamma; "but I fear it will do
no good. I have already been
to her three times."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I had better
leave her with you, then. I
hope this will be a good lesson
to her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>After dinner, Mrs. Gray carried
a plate full of pudding to
Nelly, and offered to feed her
with it; but the stubborn child
refused to eat. She made up
faces at her aunt, and said many
naughty words, which I should
not want any little boy or girl
to hear.</p>

<p>The lady came out of her
room looking very pale and anxious,
and at last began to cry.
She was quite discouraged, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
thought she would write to her
brother, and tell him she could
do nothing with his child. But
if I do so, she thought, Nelly
will be ruined. If she grows up
with such a bad temper, is so
untruthful and selfish, she will
be a trial to herself and to her
parents; and what is more than
that, she can never have the
blessing of God. "I will not
give up yet," she said, aloud.
"I will try her a little longer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>She then went down stairs, and
told Frankie he might go out
doors and play with his wheel-barrow;
but the little fellow said,
"I want to stay with you, mamma.
Nelly makes my head
ache." Poor child, he did not
feel like play while his cousin
was so naughty.</p>

<p>It was almost time for tea,
when the lady, having once
more asked God to direct her,
entered the little chamber where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
her niece was sitting. Nelly was
quiet now; but her lips stuck out
with an ugly pout.</p>

<p>"My dear child," said the lady,
sitting down near her, "it makes
us all very unhappy to have you
up here by yourself, when you
might be playing and enjoying
yourself with your cousins.
When you came to live with us,
we thought it was so pleasant to
have a dear little girl running
and dancing about the house!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
But now it seems sad because
we know by your naughty temper
you have not only offended
us, but you have displeased God.
I wish you would let me untie
your hands, and see you my darling
little Nelly once more."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry now," said Nelly,
her lip quivering. "I will be
good, aunty." The tears ran
down the little girl's cheeks, but
this time they were not angry
tears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Her aunt made haste to untie
the towels, and took Nelly in
her arms.</p>

<p>"I love you now," sobbed Nelly;
"I love you dearly."</p>

<p>"And I love you, my dear, or
I could not have kept you here
so long," said her aunt, kissing
her again and again. "I came a
great many times to the door,
and longed to take you from
this great chair, and hear your
happy voice once more; but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
knew it would be wrong in me
to do so until you were ready
to say you were sorry, and to
promise to be a good girl. You
have offended God, my dear child.
Shall I ask him to forgive you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, aunty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray then knelt with
Nelly by the chair, and prayed
God to forgive all her sins, and
to help her to keep her new resolution
to be good.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>TAKING MEDICINE.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> tea Nelly had a fine
romp with her cousins on the
lawn. Margie and Ponto were
there too; and papa and mamma
sat on the front steps, laughing
and enjoying their sport. As
the children ran round and
round, the lady saw that Nelly's
apron was unbuttoned, and that
it troubled her as she played.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
She called, "Nelly, come here
a minute."</p>

<p>The little girl stopped at once,
and then ran to her aunt. Before
this, when any one called her,
she would say, "I can't come
now;" or, "In a minute I will."
The lady was very much pleased
to see that the child obeyed
promptly. When she had fastened
the apron, Nelly clasped
her arms about her aunt's neck,
and kissed her. Her uncle smiled,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and said, "You look very happy
now, Nelly; I wish your mamma
could see your rosy cheeks."</p>

<p>"Come, Nelly, it's your turn
now," shouted Willie from the
lawn.</p>

<p>A few days after this, Mrs.
Gray sat busily sewing, while
Frankie made a barn with his
blocks, in which to put up the
pedler's cart, and Nelly was undressing
her doll. The sleeve
did not come off easily, and as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
she pulled it roughly it tore.
The little girl was angry, and
began to cry.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked
her aunt.</p>

<p>"Dolly's dress is ugly, and it's
all torn."</p>

<p>"Should you like to have a
needle, and mend it, my dear?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, aunty."</p>

<p>"May I sew some too?" asked
Frankie.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, you may mend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
this stocking." She then threaded
a needle for the little girl, and
showed her how to put the
stitches through, and afterwards
gave Frankie a darning needle
with some yarn. He had often
sewed before, and he liked the
business very much. There was
no knot in the thread, and so he
pulled it through and through.
But he thought it was sewing
for all that.</p>

<p>Nelly sat steadily at her work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
for a minute; but at last she
threw it on the floor, and said,
"I hate sewing, it's so hard."</p>

<p>"Let me see it, dear," said
aunty.</p>

<p>Nelly picked it up, and put it
into her hand.</p>

<p>She laughed when she looked
at it, and Nelly laughed too; and
then Frankie said, "O, what funny
sewing!"</p>

<p>"I'll baste you some easier
work," said her aunt; "and you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
shall have a little thimble to put
on your finger. Then you will
like to sew."</p>

<p>Nelly had behaved much better
since she was punished, so
that her uncle, aunt, and cousins
loved her better than ever.
Still there were many things
in which they hoped she would
improve.</p>

<p>One day her aunt found her
sitting on the piazza alone, eating
something, and as soon as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
saw some one coming, she put it
hastily in her pocket. It was
not more than an hour before
she complained of a bad pain in
her stomach.</p>

<p>"What have you been eating,
my dear?" asked her aunt.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Nelly.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" and the lady
looked earnestly in her face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am very sure," answered
Nelly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray sent Sally for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
warm peppermint water, and then
laid the child on the lounge.</p>

<p>For some time she lay quite
still, sucking her finger; but when
her aunt glanced toward her to
see if she were asleep, she noticed
that Nelly looked very pale
about the mouth; and presently
she jumped up, and carried her
to the closet, where she threw
up a great quantity of raisins,
which she had stolen from her
aunt's box.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>She continued very sick all
that night, and in the morning
the doctor came, and said
she must take a large dose of
castor oil.</p>

<p>The sight of oil always made
the lady very sick, and so her
uncle said he would give it to
her. He poured it out, and
mixed it with a little hot milk,
and held it to her lips. But she
would not take it. He tried to
persuade her, promised her a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
ride, told her she would be very
sick if she did not obey the doctor,
but all was of no use. She
shut her teeth, and would not
touch it.</p>

<p>Then Sally tried her skill.
"I'll make your great dolly a
new dress," she said; "come,
now, be a good girl, and then
I'll tell you how Frankie took
his medicine." It was all in vain;
Nelly still shook her head, and
refused to obey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Gray then took the child
in her lap, and spread a large
cloth under her chin, at the
same time telling Sally to bring
a cup of blackberry jelly from
the store closet. "Now, my little
Nelly," she said, "you must
take this to make you well. If
you will open your mouth and
swallow it all down like a good
girl, I will give you some nice
jelly to take the taste out, for it
is very bad. But if you don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
take it before I count three, I
shall hold you and force it down
your throat."</p>

<p>Then she began to count,&mdash;"one,
two,"&mdash;but before she
could say three, Nelly caught
the spoon and swallowed the
medicine, and then took some
jelly so quickly, that she hardly
tasted the oil.</p>

<p>"That was a right good girl,"
said her uncle. "I couldn't have
taken it any better myself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>When Nelly was well, her
aunt kindly talked with her of
the great sin which she had
committed. "You have done
just as naughty Moses did," she
said. "First, you stole the raisins,
as he stole the orange; and
then you told a wicked lie to
hide it from me, as he did to
hide his sin from his mother."
Then she told Nelly, "God hears
all we say, and sees all we do.
We can hide nothing from him;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and he says in his holy book,
'liars shall have their portion in
the lake which burneth with fire
and brimstone.'"</p>

<p>Nelly cried; and promised over
and over again to be a good girl,
and she really tried to improve.
She saw how happy her cousins
were, and how every body loved
them, and she said to herself, "I
mean to try to be just as good
as I can."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LOST ORANGE FOUND.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> little girls or boys try
to do right, every body loves to
help them. Mrs. Gray knew
that for six years her little niece
had been indulged in every wish,
and that she had never been
taught to restrain her ill humor.
She could not, therefore, expect
her to be cured at once of all
her bad habits; but she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
much pleased to see that Nelly
grew every day more amiable,
more ready to give up her own
wishes, and to try to make others
happy. Sometimes, in playing
with Frankie, she would forget,
and say an unkind word; but
the moment she saw the eye of
her aunt fixed mournfully upon
her, she would say, "I'm sorry,
Frankie."</p>

<p>When she said this, the dear
child always put up his little red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
lips to kiss her, and say, "I
sorry, too, Nelly." Sometimes he
would add, "God is sorry, too."</p>

<p>It was very rainy one morning,
and the children were obliged
to keep in doors. Frankie had for
some time been amusing himself
by hiding a ball, which he made
Ponto find and bring to him in
his teeth, while Nelly shouted
and danced at every new discovery,
saying "I never saw such
a funny dog before."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>At last they grew tired of this,
and even Ponto began to think
they had played this game quite
long enough; so Frankie sat
down on the floor, and putting one
arm around the dog's neck, said,
"Mamma, I want to hear a toly."</p>

<p>"You said some time you would
tell us some more about Moses,"
exclaimed Nelly.</p>

<p>"So I will," said mamma. "I
told you that his mother counted
the oranges, and found there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
but twelve. 'I'm sorry,' she said
to Moses, 'because I wanted one
for Sarah Christie; but I suppose
your father forgot to get it, and
I'll send her one another time.'</p>

<p>"'You can give her some figs,'
said Moses.</p>

<p>"'So I can,' replied his mother;
and then she went on cutting the
peel and tearing it down a little
way, so that, when they were put
into the large glass dish, they
looked like great yellow flowers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"'O, how pretty they are!'
said Moses.</p>

<p>"His mother then set all the
dishes on the sideboard, and
covered them over with a clean
table cloth. After tea, she said,
'I will set them out on the table,
and then when the children
have done playing, they can come
here and eat them.'</p>

<p>"When Moses' father came
home from the city, the lady
said, 'I'm sorry you forgot to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
get thirteen oranges. There were
only twelve in the basket.'</p>

<p>"'There were thirteen when I
brought them home,' said papa;
'I am sure of it, because I counted
them myself, and they were nice
ones too; I had to give three
cents apiece for them, though
they are quite plenty now.'</p>

<p>"'I don't know where the other
can have gone,' said mamma,
looking very sober, as a painful
suspicion flashed through her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I hope Moses wouldn't take
one without leave,' said the gentleman.</p>

<p>"'I asked him,' replied mamma,
'and he said he hadn't
touched them.'</p>

<p>"'Where is he?' asked papa,
'I will ask him. I don't care at
all about the orange, because I
can easily get another; but
somebody must have taken it,
and I am afraid it was our little
boy.' The gentleman then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
went to the door and called,
'Moses! Moses!'</p>

<p>"Presently Moses came, and
his father took him in his lap,
and said, 'Tell me, my dear,
have you taken an orange from
the basket?'</p>

<p>"'No, papa,' said the boy, his
face growing very red. 'I told
mamma I hadn't touched them.'</p>

<p>"The gentleman couldn't think
that his darling child would tell
a lie; so he put him down to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
floor, and inquired, 'Have you
asked cook?'</p>

<p>"'No,' said mamma; 'I am
quite sure she wouldn't meddle
with my things.'</p>

<p>"'Just then, cook came in with
the cloth for supper, and mamma
said to Moses, 'I shall have time,
I think, to dress you before tea.
Run up quick to my room, and
I will get a clean ruffle, and baste
it in your new sack."</p>

<p>"While she was doing this, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
pulled off his sack and pantaloons
that he had worn every
day, and threw them on the
floor. Then his mother washed
his face, and neck, and arms, and
hands, very clean, and brushed
his hair smoothly off his forehead,
so that he looked very
nicely indeed. And all the time
Moses was talking about his party,
and telling what a pleasant
time he should have.</p>

<p>"'It's your birthday,' said his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
mother, kissing him, 'and you
must remember to be a very
good boy. Be kind to your
dear little cousins and playmates,
and let them play with
any of your toys. Here, let me
hang up your clothes, and we
will go down to tea.'</p>

<p>"She took the pantaloons from
the floor, and said, 'Why, Moses,
what have you stuffed into
your pocket? Here is your
handkerchief wet through.' She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
pulled out first an India rubber
ball, and then&mdash;O, what do you
think?&mdash;why, the lost orange,
all sucked and gone except the
peel.</p>

<p>"'O Moses!' was all the poor
mother could say. She sank into
a chair, and covered her face with
her hands; but the tears trickled
down through her fingers.</p>

<p>"The little boy began to cry;
he wished his mother had not
found him out, because it made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
her feel so badly. Presently the
tea bell rang; but the lady never
stirred from her seat. She was
mourning over her son, and thinking
what she ought to do to punish
him for his great sin.</p>

<p>"'Supper is ready,' called out
papa from the stairs.</p>

<p>"'Don't wait for me,' answered
the lady; 'I can't go down.'</p>

<p>"'What is the matter?' asked
the gentleman, springing up the
stairs and coming into the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma began to weep again.
She could not speak, but she held
up the skin of the orange, and
glanced toward Moses, who was
sitting in a chair by himself crying
bitterly.</p>

<p>"'So he did take it, after all,'
said papa, in a stern voice.</p>

<p>"'I'm sorry, papa,' sobbed the
boy.</p>

<p>"'What a wicked boy you
must be, to steal and lie, and
on your birthday too,' said his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
father, 'when we were trying to
make you so happy!'</p>

<p>"'I never will do so again,'
said Moses.</p>

<p>"'You must be punished, so
that you will remember it,' said
his father.</p>

<p>"'Stay here,' said his mother;
'I will send cook up with some
supper for you.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BIRTHDAY PARTY.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">She</span> sat down at the table,
and poured the tea, but she could
not eat. Her heart was too sorrowful.
She arose, and returned
to the chamber, where Moses was
eating a slice of bread and butter.
When he had finished it,
she said, 'Wipe your hands on
the towel, and take off your
clothes.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Are you going to whip me,
mamma? I never will be so
naughty again,' exclaimed the
boy, beginning to cry louder
than ever.</p>

<p>"'No,' said his mother, 'I am
going to put you to bed.'</p>

<p>"'I can't see my party, then,'
screamed Moses, catching hold
of his mother's dress.</p>

<p>"'Nor eat any of the good
things, my child. You have
been a wicked boy, and broken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
God's holy commands; and I
must punish you. You don't
know how you've made mother's
heart ache,' said the lady,
trying to keep back her tears.
'I did not think you could be
so naughty. When I know how
displeased the dear Saviour must
be, I tremble for you.'</p>

<p>"'I didn't mean to eat the
orange, mamma; it smelled so
good, I only thought I would
suck it a little.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"'If you had told me that at
first, I would gladly have forgiven
you,' said mamma; 'but
you told wicked lies to hide
your sin. You forgot that God
was looking at you all the time,
and knew all that was in your
heart. You must pray to him
to forgive you, and to make you
a good boy.'</p>

<p>"Moses cried so that he could
hardly stand. His mother took
off his clothes, put on his night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
gown, and helped him into bed.
Then she knelt by his bed side,
and prayed that the means used
to punish him might help him
to remember what a great sin
lying is. She asked God to forgive
him, and help him from that
hour to be an honest, truthful
boy.</p>

<p>"Moses slept in a small room,
next to her own, and as the lady
thought some of the little party
might run up there, she locked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the door, and went herself down
the back way.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon the bell rang,
and Moses stopped crying to
listen. He heard happy voices
of children running through the
hall. Then they asked, 'Where's
Moses?' But he could not hear
what his mother answered.</p>

<p>"In a few minutes a carriage
drove up, and there was another
ring of the bell. This time it
was his cousins, and he heard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
them laughing and talking together.</p>

<p>"Before half an hour all the
company had assembled. Some
of the little girls went up to the
front room, and he could hear
his mother's voice as she went
with them. She was talking
very kindly, but he thought she
did not feel happy, it was so sad.</p>

<p>"O, what a long evening that
was! He could not go to sleep,
for every few minutes there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a merry burst of laughter from
the room below; and he knew
that his papa was teaching them
some pretty games. Every time
he heard this he began to cry
again. And then he wondered
whether his mother would tell
them why he was not there, and
what they would say.</p>

<p>"At last he heard them all
walk out into the dining room,
and papa's voice saying, 'I will
take Katy because she is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
youngest.' Now he knew they
were going to sit at table and
eat the nice fruit.</p>

<p>"'O, dear!' he sobbed, 'how
sorry I am!' And then, for the
first time, he began to think how
wicked it was to deceive his dear
parents, who had been so kind to
him all his life. 'I made mamma
cry,' he said softly. 'I'm sorry
for that, too.'</p>

<p>"As soon as Satan heard Moses
say that, he ran away and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
hid; and the good Spirit came,
and whispered to Moses, and
presently he got out of his bed,
and knelt down by his low
chair, and prayed softly. But
Jesus heard what he said, and
looked into his heart, and saw
he was really sorry he had been
a wicked boy, and then God
forgave him.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon the children all
came rushing up the stairs to
put on their clothes, for the carriages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
had come to take them
home. Moses was not crying
now. He lay quiet and still;
and he heard them say, 'Good
by! good by! Please give my
love to Moses;' and then the
door was shut, and the house
all still again.</p>

<p>"When mamma came up stairs
she carried the light into her little
boy's room to see if he was
awake. His eyes were wide open,
and as soon as he saw her, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
said, 'You might give my orange
to Sarah Christie, mamma,
because I wasn't down there
to eat it.'</p>

<p>"Then mamma put up her
handkerchief quick to wipe the
tears from her eyes; and she
went up to the bed and kissed
her boy, for she knew that he
had repented of his sin.</p>

<p>"'I am sorry, very sorry,' he
said, pulling her face down to
his; 'I prayed hard to God to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
forgive me, and make me good.
Will you forgive me, mamma?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, my darling. I will
gladly forgive you, and I hope
this may be a lesson to you as
long as you live.'"</p>

<p>Nelly looked very sober while
her aunt was telling this story.
She began to see how naughty
she had been, and to hope that
God would forgive her too.</p>

<p>As soon as his mother had
finished, Frankie said, "O, I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
so glad Moses became a good
boy! Did he ever steal or tell
lies again?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear, I am happy to
tell you that from the hour when
he so heartily repented of his
great sin, and so earnestly asked
God to forgive him, he became
an honest and truthful boy. But
I have talked a long time, and
can only add one incident, which
occurred nearly six months later
than the birthday party.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Moses had a cousin whose
name was Eugene. He lived in
a city many hundred miles distant.
He was also an only child;
but unlike Moses, he had been
foolishly indulged in every desire
of his heart, until he had become
exceedingly selfish, wilful, and
passionate. Eugene accompanied
his parents on a visit to
his aunt, and though younger
than his cousin, began at once
to tyrannize over him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"One day a loud cry was heard
from the play room, and presently
Eugene came running to his
mother, complaining that Moses
had broken his little wagon, and
then had struck him with his
Indian bow.</p>

<p>"'How is this, Moses?' asked
his mother; 'did you strike your
cousin?'</p>

<p>"The little fellow fixed his
large, earnest eyes full upon
hers, as he exclaimed, 'O, no,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
indeed, mother! Eugene knows
I did not touch him. We were
playing together, when the wagon
wheel hit the trunk and broke
it. Then he got angry, and
pinched me on my arm.</p>

<p>"'I don't mind that,' he added,
as his aunt pointed to a large red
spot near his elbow; 'but I'm
dreadfully sorry he didn't tell
the truth.'"</p>
